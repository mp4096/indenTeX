# equation*:
  # label: eq:test
  a + b

# tikzpicture [x = 2 cm]:
  \draw (0, 0) -- (1, 1);

This is a known bug:
# equation: % test
  a + b

This should be converted correctly (also check if all environments are closed at the EOF):
# a:
  # b:
    # c:
      # d:
        # e:
          # f:
            # g:
              # h:
                # i:
                  foobar
